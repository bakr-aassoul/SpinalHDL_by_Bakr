# SpinalHDL Documentation by Bakr

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to **SpinalHDL** a modern, type-safe HDL embedded in Scala. It introduces the languageâ€™s fundamentals and walks through examples covering simulation and code generation. You'll explore core concepts using small modules, all the way up to complex designs like the **VexRiscv** processor.

### Highlights
- Signal types and module creation (`Bool`, `UInt`, `Bundle`, etc.)
- Registers vs. wires (`Reg(...)` vs. direct `val`)
- Control flow constructs (`when`, `otherwise`)
- Simulation workflows with `SimConfig.withWave`
- Generating synthesizable Verilog/VHDL
- Real-world examples: comparator, counter, clock divider, PWM
- Advanced design: modular VexRiscv CPU with a plugin system

##  Prerequisites

- **Java JDK** (Java 11 or above)
- **Scala 2.13**
- **sbt** (Scala Build Tool)
- Optional but recommended:
  - **IntelliJ IDEA** with Scala plugin
  - **Verilator** or **GHDL** for simulation

Refer to the [Getting Started with SpinalHDL]([https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Getting%20Started) guide for help with setup.

##  Documentation with Sphinx + Markdown
I used **Sphinx with Markdown** (via MyST or recommonmark) to author documentation in docs/source/, and generate both HTML and PDF outputs.
